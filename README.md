# Name Sorter

A simple application to sort a list of names.

## Solution

## Assumptions

- Last name is mandatory
- Last name will always be at the end of the line
- Each line contains a name of a single person
- Names of a person are separated from at least one space
- Multiple spaces and tabs between names will be ignored
- Empty lines are ignored
- Pre and post spaces will be ignored and trimmed
- Names that exceeds the maximum number of allowed given names (3) are considered invalid
- Invalid names are ignored in the process and will be excluded from the output
